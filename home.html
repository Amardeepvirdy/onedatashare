    <h3>Beta, you say?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, StorkCloud is developed by a small group of graduate students at the
      <a href="http://buffalo.edu">University at Buffalo</a> who lack the human
      resources to establish and maintain a dedicated quality assurance team.
      Instead, we're trying something a little unusual &mdash; starting a public
      beta testing phase without thorough internal testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means StorkCloud is not only experimental, it is <em>very</em> experimental.
      The system is liable to fail, crash, stall, leave transfers partially complete,
      forget about jobs, be taken down for intermittent periods while we fix problems,
      not support certain remote servers, or otherwise not work properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user inferface is also very unpolished and will likely do some strange
      or surprising things.
      Many actions do not currently give any visual indicators that they are
      in progess or have completed, and some interface elements are nonfunctional
      placeholders or are buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next few months until StorkCloud has reached an acceptable level of
      stability, it should not be used for any mission-critical operations or be
      trusted with any sensitive information.
      We will, however, greatly appreciate any bug reports or other feedback from
      testers.
      Bug reports can be submitted
      <a href="https://github.com/didclab/stork/issues">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, as an academic endeavour, StorkCloud will be used as a testing 
      platform for various experimental scheduling and optimization algorithms and
      transfer protocols.
      Such features should be used with caution.
      New features introduced in the future will be marked in a conspicuous way
      to indicate their experimental status.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, StorkCloud will be undergoing many changes during this testing period.
      New features will be introduced and problems will be fixed as we get to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheduler component underlying the system is open source. We invite
      developers to contribute patches and new features through pull requests to our
      our GitHub repository:
      <a href="https://github.com/didclab">https://github.com/didclab/stork</a>

    <h3>User Accounts</h3>
    <p>
      Until StorkCloud is announced stable, we reserve the right to reset or
      rollback the server state at any time for testing or debugging purposes.
      As a result, user accounts may vanish without warning, and with them all
      transfer history and stored credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will also be removing user accounts at the end of beta testing, so anything
      that happens during beta testing will not be carried over to the final release.
