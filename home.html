    <h3>About StorkCloud</h3>
    <p>
      StorkCloud is a cloud-hosted data transfer and optimization service which aims
      to eliminate end-to-end data movement bottlenecks by efficiently scheduling and
      optimizing data transfer tasks and effectively utilizing underlying networks.
      StorkCloud provides enhanced data management capabilities such as end-to-end
      throughput optimization, early error detection and recovery, and responsive
      metadata retrieval for a broad range of data-intensive cloud computing
      applications.  It optimizes data transfers with application-level techniques to
      predict the best combination of protocol and end-system parameters for parallel
      end-to-end dataflow optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheduler component underlying the system is open source. We invite
      developers to contribute patches and new features through pull requests to
